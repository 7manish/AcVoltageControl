# AcVoltageControl
AC voltage controllers (ac line voltage controllers) are employed to vary the RMS value of the alternating voltage applied to a load circuit
by introducing Thyristors between the load and a constant voltage ac source. The RMS value of alternating voltage applied to a load circuit
is controlled by controlling the triggering angle of the Thyristors in the ac voltage controller circuits.
